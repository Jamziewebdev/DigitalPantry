## Digital Pantry

A digital pantry for my messy mind

I have always wanted an application like this, but never got around to creating it. Finally, with some exra time on my hands,
I decided that today would be the day! An with two birds, one stone and all, I also took the opportunity to brush up on my
dormant Python skills.
